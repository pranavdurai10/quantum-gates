## Description

This repository contains a collection of Qiskit implementations for the fundamental gates used in quantum computing. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding and working with quantum gates, enabling them to explore the foundational building blocks of quantum algorithms.

## Contents
The repository currently includes implementations of the following gates:

1. Pauli gates: Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, and Pauli-Z gates [ON-GOING]
2. Hadamard gate [YET-TO-IMPLEMENT]
3. Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate [YET-TO-IMPLEMENT]
4. SWAP gate [YET-TO-IMPLEMENT]
5. Toffoli gate [YET-TO-IMPLEMENT]
6. Controlled-phase gates: Controlled-Z (CZ) gate, Controlled-S (CS) gate, Controlled-T (CT) gate [YET-TO-IMPLEMENT]
7. U gates: U1, U2, U3 gates for arbitrary unitary operations [YET-TO-IMPLEMENT]

## Contributions
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have additional implementations of quantum gates or improvements to the existing ones, feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can expand this collection of gate implementations and enhance its usefulness to the quantum computing community.
